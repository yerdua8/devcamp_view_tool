## Hi there! Welcome to Bottega Devcamp

### Instructions to enter into the bash shell

To startup the Postgres database, the command is:

```
sudo service postgresql start
```

To generate a new rails application, the command is:

```
rails new AppName -T --database=postgresql
```

Change into the app:

```
cd AppName
```

Create and migrate the database:

```
rails db:create && rails db:migrate
```

To run the Rails server on C9, the command is:

```
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT
```

In order to view your page that you are working on while in C9, after starting the server, youâ€™ll then use the preview button on the top bar to be able to view the page.

For more information on how to use Cloud9, visit http://docs.c9.io for our documentation. If you want, you can also go watch some training videos at
http://www.youtube.com/user/c9ide.

Good luck with the coding!
